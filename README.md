## Folder Structure (Simplified)

```
/app
  /owner
    list-car/page.jsx       # Owner-only page to add car
  /blogs
    [id]/page.js            # Blog / Car details
  /Components
    Navbar.jsx
    CarCard.jsx
    AddCarForm.jsx
  /api
    /cars/route.js          # REST API for cars
    /auth/[...nextauth]/route.js # NextAuth API
/public
  /Images                  # Static images
```

---

## Additional Notes

* Only users with the role `owner` can access `/owner/list-car`.
* Google login is handled through `/signin` page.
* Featured cars can be configured in the backend or API responses.
* Images in `/public` folder should be referenced by path (e.g., `/Images/car1.png`) instead of `import`.
* For deployment, use **Vercel** and make sure `NEXTAUTH_URL` and Google OAuth redirect URI match your production domain.
